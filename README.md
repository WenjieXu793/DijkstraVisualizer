# DijkstraVisualizer
A visualizer for Dijkstra's shortest pathfinding algorithm.

# Instructions:
After running the program, the console will prompt you for the length and height of the grid/window.

Type the values and hit enter for each.

Upon inputting the values, a window will then be created where you can draw the start, target, and barriers.

To select a starting position, you will use the middle mouse button.

To select a target position, you will use the right mouse button.

You can click or drag with the left mouse buttons to draw walls.

Press the space bar on your keyboard when you want to begin the path-finding algorithm.

# Note
The light blue shows the expanding area that Dijkstra's algorithm is exploring.

The dark blue shows the area that it has already explored.

The white indicates barriers that the algorithm must go around.

The red represents starting position.

The green represents the target position.

The bronze color represents the final "shortest" discovered path from the start position to the target position.
