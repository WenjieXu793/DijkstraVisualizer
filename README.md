# DijkstraVisualizer
A visualizer for Dijkstra's shortest pathfinding algorithm.

# Instructions:

After running the program, the console will prompt you for the length and height of the grid/window.
Type the values and hit enter for each.
Upon inputting the values, a window will then be created where you can draw the start, target, and barriers.
To select a starting position, you will use the middle mouse button.
To select a target position, you will use the right mouse button.
To draw walls, you can click or drag with the left mouse buttons.
When you want to begin the path-finding algorithm, press the space bar on your keyboard.
